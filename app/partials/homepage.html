<p>Neubot is a research project on network neutrality of the <a class="reference external" href="http://nexa.polito.it/">Nexa Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dauin.polito.it/">Politecnico di Torino</a>. The project is 	based on a lightweight <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/neubot/neubot/blob/master/COPYING">open source</a> program that interested users can <a href="http://www.neubot.org/download">download and install</a> on their computers. The program runs in the background and	periodically performs transmission tests with test servers, hosted by	the distributed <a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab</a> platform, and (in future) with other	instances of the program itself.  Transmission tests probe the Internet	using various application level protocols and test results are saved both	locally and on the test servers. The results dataset contains samples	from various providers and is <a href="http://www.neubot.org/data">published on the web</a>, allowing anyone to	analyze the data for research purposes.
